# my-100-days-of-swiftui-projects
These are my projects from doing Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI.
Hi,
Welcome to the projects I built from with the help of Paul Hudson's 100 Days of SwiftUI!
My history with programming and developing is quite short at the moment, but I am wanting that to change.
When I was 17 years old, and a senior in high school, I decided to take my school's only Computer Programming course.... and it was for Visual Basic.
I remember doing great in that course, and building a few programs simply with If/Then statements.
I went to college for one year, only taking prerequisites and eventually decided college wasn't for me.
After dropping out of school, I started working construction/labor/operating jobs of all sorts.
My mindset was to get out of my debt and work the best paying jobs that I could, but it didn't take long for me to find that way of life boring and not for me.
Then I found Paul Hudson's course and decided to give Swift a shot, see if iOS development would be something I would like.
After just 2-3 weeks, I was hooked. I loved the language, I loved how new everything is, and I love the way time flies by as I type away.
With completion of this course, I definitely plan to branch out into more and more knowledge, and eventually make this folder a memory to look back on and think "hahaha, oh wow. i had so much to learn back then. look how far i came."
So I will be carrying that energy into all my projects!
